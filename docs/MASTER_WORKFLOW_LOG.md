## 🧭 Reader Orientation (Rule 11)

- **Purpose**: บันทึกหลักฐานของการทำงานตามวงจร Plan-Do-Check-Act (Rule 14)
- **Relationship**: เชื่อมโยง Task จาก Git และ Documentation ไปสู่การตัดสินใจจริง

## Summary & Prime Directive (Rule 0)

**WHAT**: Audit trail of system evolution.
**WHY**: Traceability of decisions.
**HOW**: PDCA Cycle records.

## Analysis & Decisions (Rule 4)

- **Deep Workflow Rationale (Extensive)**:
  The Master Workflow Log for Kyx Governance v3.1 is designed to be the definitive **Institutional Memory** of the entire ecosystem. During our analysis of governance lifecycles, we observed that critical design pivots—such as the transition to Super-Governance v3.1—were often poorly captured in fragmented Git commits. We have therefore decided to implement a mandatory **Recursive PDCA Logging Protocol**. This decision ensures that every major rule shift is documented through a complete Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle, providing a high-fidelity audit trail that is accessible to both humans and AI agents (Rule 14).

  Furthermore, we have standardized on the **Super-Governance v3.1 Contract** as our absolute operational anchor. This represents a commitment to document fidelity where the "Technical Why" (Rationale) is prioritized alongside the implementation details. We also analyzed the impact of "Audit Gaps" and decided to enforce a strict **Document Integrity Invariant**. This ensures that every entry in this log is backed by verified technical evidence and source signatures (Rule 5). By requiring that this log be periodically synchronized across the global network (Rule 19), we ensure that the "Source of Truth" for our institutional evolution is always accurate, verified, and ready for professional-grade audit. This extreme-fidelity discipline is what allows Kyx Governance to remain the supreme authority for the global AI-automated network.

## Capability Traceability (Rule 5)

| Capability        | Technical Mechanism | Infrastructure         | Source Signature |
| :---------------- | :------------------ | :--------------------- | :--------------- |
| Lifecycle Logging | PDCA Entry          | MASTER_WORKFLOW_LOG.md | Rule 14          |
| Task Delivery     | Analytical Commits  | Git                    | Rule 17          |

### Cycle: Rollout Super-Governance v3.1 (Forced Compliance)

- **PLAN**: ดับเบิลความเข้มงวดของ Rule 3 (Word count + Metadata).
- **DO**: สร้าง Migration 18, อัปเดต Linter v3.1, และอัปเกรดเอกสารเดิม.
- **CHECK**: Verify via `validate-docs.sh` (must fail if brief).
- **ACT**: Approved v3.1 standard as the global baseline.

## Invariants & Failure Modes (Rule 6)

- **Invariant**: Documentation corresponds to implementation (Rule 11).
- **Mode**: Gapped auditing (Prevention: PDCA forced entries).
- **Status**: [x] Zero Hardcode active [x] Traceability established.
