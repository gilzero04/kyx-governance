### ⚔️ Operational Directives

1. **Rule 1 (Workflow)**: YOU MUST run pre-work searches and sync snapshots BEFORE suggesting changes.
2. **Rule 5 (Traceability)**: Every code change requires a `file::symbol` link in the documentation.
3. **Rule 11 (Contract)**: Mismatch between code and docs is a governance violation. Update both.
4. **Rule 16 (Search First)**: Look for existing incidents before implementing "fixes".
   5- [ ] **Tech Stack Identified?** (e.g., Rust/SurrealDB/Ntex for Governance)

- [ ] **Logical Rationale Included?** (At least 150 words of technical WHY)
- [ ] **Memory/Safety Analysis?** (Rust-specific Ownership/Borrowing depth)
- [ ] **Verification Proof?** (Does list-documents reflect your new or updated files?)

## 🏁 Delivery Requirement (Rule 17)

- Changes MUST be on a new branch.
- Commit message MUST include the Rationale (WHY).
